# CGAN-TEXTUAL-DATA-CLASSIFICATION
This project explores the use of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to enhance the detection and diagnosis of Spina Bifida, a neural tube defect affecting the spinal cord. The aim is to improve medical image classification accuracy by generating high-quality, class-specific synthetic data to augment limited clinical datasets.
